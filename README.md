# üåå Our Last Light

**Our Last Light** is a survival adventure game built in Java for a school project at Epitech Nancy. Set in a procedurally generated world, players must explore, gather resources, build shelters, and survive in a hostile environment filled with dynamic challenges. The game leverages an **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture to efficiently manage game entities and systems, making the game structure modular and easy to expand.

## üåç Project Overview

**Our Last Light** is designed to immerse players in a mysterious, procedurally generated world where survival depends on skill, resourcefulness, and adaptability. Built as part of a Java programming project, this game emphasizes modular design through the **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture, allowing for scalable gameplay and clean separation of data and logic.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Procedurally Generated World**: Dynamic biomes, resources, and landmarks appear randomly, offering a unique experience each time.
- **Survival Mechanics**: Manage hunger, thirst, health, and stamina while fending off environmental hazards.
- **Modular Character Abilities**: Different classes, each with unique abilities and perks.
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Distinct gameplay experiences during the day and night, affecting visibility, resource availability, and danger levels.
- **Camp Building**: Build and upgrade your camp to increase safety and expand survival options.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 8** or higher
- A Java IDE or compiler (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or command-line `javac`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/LittleMoonie/our-last-light.git](https://github.com/LittleMoonie/Our-Last-Light.git)
   cd our-last-light
```
Compile the Java files:

```bash
javac -d bin src/*.java
```
Run the game:

```bash
java -cp bin GameLauncher
```

## üé≤ Gameplay
In Our Last Light, players navigate a procedurally generated world filled with dangers and mysteries. Survive by managing your resources, crafting tools, and building a safe camp. Each class has unique strengths and weaknesses, so strategy and planning are crucial to survival.

## üß© ECS Architecture
Our Last Light is structured using an Entity-Component-System (ECS) design pattern, which breaks down game elements into modular components, making the game easier to expand and maintain.

### Entity
The Entity class represents any object in the game world, such as characters, items, and environmental elements. Entities contain only components (data), not behavior.

### Component
Components are pure data holders that define the attributes of entities. Examples include:

- PositionComponent: Stores an entity's position in the world.
- HealthComponent: Tracks health points.
- VelocityComponent: Contains movement speed and direction.

### System
Systems contain the logic of the game and operate on entities with specific components. Examples of systems include:

- MovementSystem: Updates positions based on velocity.
- HealthSystem: Manages health status and conditions.
- ProceduralGenerationSystem: Handles the generation of biomes, resources, and terrain.

### World
The World class acts as the main orchestrator, managing entities and systems. It updates each system in the game loop and handles entity lifecycle events.

```java
public class World {
    private List<Entity> entities;
    private List<System> systems;

    public void update(float deltaTime) {
        for (System system : systems) {
            system.update(deltaTime);
        }
    }
}
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Procedural Generation
The **Procedural Generation System** is responsible for creating the game world. It generates various biomes, places resources, and populates the environment with enemies and items, ensuring a unique layout each time the game is played. The system allows for adjustable parameters, making it easy to tweak the difficulty and density of resources.
